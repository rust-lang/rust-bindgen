# Diagnostics

Some commands can use the diagnostics function to achieve emitting diagnostics. Following examples may help
you to add more diagnostic messages

## Examples

command:
```shell
cargo run --features=experimental /usr/include/stdint.h "--no-copy=*" "--no-debug=My((?'\!'Foo).)+" --emit-diagnostics
```

output:
```shell
Running `target/debug/bindgen /usr/include/stdint.h '--no-copy=*' '--no-debug=My((?'\''\'\!''\''Foo).)+' --emit-diagnostics`
warning: regex parse error:
  |
0 |     ^(*)$
1 |       ^
  |
  = error: repetition operator missing expression
  = note: this regular expression was passed via `--no-copy`
  = help: using wildcard patterns "*" is no longer considered valid. Consider using ".*" instead
warning: regex parse error:
  |
0 |     ^(My((?'\!'Foo).)+)$
1 |            ^
  |
  = error: unrecognized flag
  = note: this regular expression was passed via `--no-debug`
Warning: can't set `binop_separator = Back`, unstable features are only available in nightly channel.

```

command:
```shell
cargo run --features=experimental bindgen-tests/tests/headers/func_ptr_in_struct.h --with-derive-hash --with-derive-partialeq --with-derive-eq --rustified-enum ".*" --emit-diagnostics
```
output:
```shell

```

command:
```shell
cargo run --features=experimental /usr/include/argp.h  --emit-diagnostics
```

output:
```shell
